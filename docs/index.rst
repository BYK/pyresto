.. note:: We did `work on tests <https://github.com/BYK/pyresto/commit/
          dbaa518f4ed07d38a3ed537bb52dce9868f3acbf>`_ but after moving to
          `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/>`_, we had to start
          from scratch. TL;DR no tests currently but we are working hard to
          add solid unit tests to the project with Travis CI integration.
          Current code base is pretty solid but tests are essential so if
          you feel like helping
