class Model(object):
    """
    The base model class where every data model using pyresto should be
    inherited from. Uses ModelBase as its metaclass for various reasons
    explained in ModelBase.

    _secure class variable determines wheter the HTTPS or the HTTP protocol
    should be used for requests made to the REST server. Defaults to True
    meaning HTTPS will be used.

    _host is the hostname for the API endpoint for the Model which is used in
    conjunction with the _secure property to generate a bound HTTP request
    factory at the time of class definition. See ModelBase for implementation.

    _path is the path to be used while fetching the instance from the server.
    It is a format string using the new format notation defined for str.format
    method. The primary key will be passed under the same name defined in the
    _pk property and any other named parameters passed to the Model.get method
    or the class constructor are available to this string for formatting.

    _continuator is a class method which receives the class object (like a
    regular class method) and the request made to the server. This method is
    expected to return a continuation URL for the fetched resource, if there is
    any (like the next page's URL for paginated content) and None otherwise.
    Defaults to a dummy function which always returns None.

    _parser is a class method which receives the class object and the body text
    of the server response to be parsed. It is expected to return a dictionary
    object having the properties of the related model. Defaults to a
    "staticazed" version of json.loads so it is not necessary to override it if
    the response type is valid JSON.

    _pk is a class variable where the attribute name for the primary key of the
    model is stored as a string. This property is required and not providing a
    default is intentional to force developers to explicitly define it on every
    model class.

    _fetched is an instance variable which is used to determine if the model
    instance is filled from the server or not. It can be modified for certain
    usages but this is not advised. If _fetched is false when an attribute not
    in the class dictionary tried to be accessed, the __fetch method is called
    before raising an AttributeError.

    _get_params is an instance variable which holds the additional named get
    parameters provided to the Model.get class method to fetch the instance. It
    is used internally by the relation classes to have more info about the
    current model instance while fetching its related resources.
